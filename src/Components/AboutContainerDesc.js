    description:
      "Hi! I’m Carlo Damalerio, a junior front-end developer with love for creating responsive and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, intuitive designs. Though I did not take a computer science course, since 2024 I've been deeply committed to learning programming. I’ve taken online courses to strengthen my skills about coding and design. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, React. I'm always learning new technologies like AI and pushing myself to grow. Outside of coding, I love playing badminton, boxing, working out at the gym, travelling, watching movies, going to restaurants, and most of the time playing video games in my game room.",
